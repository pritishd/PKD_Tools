@package PKD_Tools.libWeights
@brief This package allows you to import/export weights of various deformers.

@details For a seamless import/export the following is assumed
<ol>
<li>The geometry is imported and not referenced. </li>
<li>The number of vertices on the geometry itself has not changed.</li>
<li>During export, the target geometry must be selected.</li>
<li>If there are existing deformers on the geometry, make sure their names are the same as the exported data so that correct weights are imported</li>
<li>If you want the deformer to be rebuilt ensure that the same deformer name does not exists in target/import scene. As a best practice, always rename your
deformers in your source/export scene.</li>
</ol>

Current supported deformers are
<ul>
<li>SkinClusters</li>
<li>Clusters</li>
<li>Blendshapes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weights/MultiWeights</h3>
Deals with exporting and importing the weight of the deformer on a target geometry. By default we use Maya native <i>deformerWeights</i> command which
exports out a XML file. However in the case of blendshapes this is not possible yet. (Maya limitation? Needs for exploration)

With this, we save the hassle of reading the weights and exporting them as Maya does that for us. Similarly it takes care of the same on the import side.

Furthermore this will ensure a smooth data transfer between different versions of Maya as hopefully Maya will take care of legacy compalitiy issues.
<ul>
<li>Weights class deals with deformers which usually only has one iteration on a geometry eg skinCluster.</li>
<li>MultiWeights class deals with deformers where muliple instances of the geometry eg blendshapes and clusters</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data</h4>
In addition to the weights file this class would also gather data which will be useful in rebuilding the deformers eg the order of the clusters,
whether it is a relative cluster, the joints used in the skinCluster etc.

<h3>Weightmanager</h3>
The WeightManager class works with multiple geometry at the same time. An xml file saves out the following information
<ol>
<li>the list of geometeries processed</li>
<li>Data(as explained before) about the deformers for each geometry</li>
</ol>

<h3>Further Notes</h3>
 With the Weights/Multiweights class you may choose to reimport the weights to a renamed geometry by passing the target to the relevant class, however this may
mean you will have rewrite/extend the capability of the of relevant WeightManager class to handle this

@attention
@htmlonly <li> @endhtmlonlyThis module has not been tested with referenced objects. You may want to set the namespace to ":". Alternatively use the @ref libFile.importFile() command to import your file without namespace. @htmlonly </li> @endhtmlonly
@htmlonly <li> @endhtmlonlyCurrently only polygon models are supported@htmlonly </li> @endhtmlonly

      @attention &bull; This class does not supports painted weights on the envelope. However individual painted weights are supported.
      @attention &bull; If you are rebuilding the blendshapes, then the target shapes needs to imported first before the weights are imported. You may use the @ref libFile.importFile() command to import the file with the blendshapes.
