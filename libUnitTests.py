@brief Templates for the unit tests
@details Basic unit tests structure to be used to test for various modules such as as rigging or other tools. It follows
the principle of a scientific hypothesis
-# First we recreate the test conditions through the help of the Droid
-# Then we test those values of various nodes to the ones we expect and also to check for potential failures. This is
done with the help of UnitTestCase
-# Display the result through the BatchTest

All of these unit test need to run in mayapy so in order for the maya commands to work. Ideally this should be setup in your IDE's Python console
